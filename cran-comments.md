## Resubmission
This is a new version. In this version I have:

  * Made breaking changes to the package, hence a new major version number
  * Support for `XLSX` format
  * Write output to file directly
  * Separate functions to compare output and create output tables
  * Cleaner abstractions in functions
  * More bugs squashed
  * Color blind friendly default colors

## Test environments

  * ubuntu 16.04 (on travis-ci)
  * win-builder (devel and release)
  * Windows (on Appveyor)
