## Resubmission
This is a new version. In this version I have:

* Fixed a bug where the package would corrupt the global environment with `stringsAsFactors=FALSE`
* Added `futile.logger` as a potential option for logging messages.

## Test environments
*  local OS X install - 10.14, R 3.5.1
*  ubuntu 16.04 (on travis-ci)
*  Windows (on Appveyor)
*  Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1, R-devel, 32/64 bit (Rhub)
*  Ubuntu Linux 16.04 LTS, R-release, GCC (Rhub)
*  Fedora Linux, R-devel, clang, gfortran (Rhub)
