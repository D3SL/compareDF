# Introduction

This package shows what has changed between two data frames that have the same columnar
structure. Such comparison is useful in many cases, for example when you expect only minor 
changes in the data across two data sets such as:

* Variation of a dataset across different time periods for the same grouping
* Variation of values for different algorithms, etc.

# Usage

The package has a single function, `compare_df`. It takes in two data frames, and one or 
more grouping variables and does a comparison between the the two. In addition you can 
sepcificy columns to ignore, decide how many rows of changes to be displayed in the case 
of the HTML output, and decide what tolerance you want to provide to detect change.

# Examples

```{r}
