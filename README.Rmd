# Introduction

This package shows what has changed between two data frames that have the same columnar
structure. Such comparison is useful in many cases, for example when you expect to see   
changes in the data across two data sets such as:

* Variation of a dataset across different time periods for the same grouping
* Variation of values for different algorithms, etc.

# Usage

The package has a single function, `compare_df`. It takes in two data frames, and one or 
more grouping variables and does a comparison between the the two. In addition you can 
sepcificy columns to ignore, decide how many rows of changes to be displayed in the case 
of the HTML output, and decide what tolerance you want to provide to detect change.

# Basic Example

Let's take the example of a teacher who wants to compare the marks and grades of students across
two years, 2010 and 2011. The data is stored in tabular format.

```{r}
data("results_2010", "results_2011")
print(results_2010)
print(results_2011)
```

The data shows the performance of students in two divisions, A and B for two years. Some subjects
like _Maths, Physics, Chemistry and Art_ are given scores while others like _Discipline and PE_ are 
given grades. 

It is possible that there are students of the same name in two divisions, for example, there is 
a _Rohit_ in both the divisions in 2011.

It is also possible that some students have dropped out, or added new across the two years. 
Eg: - _Mugger and Dhakkan_ dropped out while _Vikram and Dikchik_ where added in the Division B

The package allows a user to quickly identify these changes.

## Basic Comparison
Now let's compare the performance of the students across the years. The grouping variables is the
_Student_ columns. We will ignore the _Division_ columns and assume that the student names are unique 
across divisions. In this sub-example, if a student appears in two division, he has studied in both 
of them.

```{r}
library(compareDF)
ctable_student = compare_df(results_2011, results_2010, c("Student"))
ctable_student$comparison_df

```

By default, no columns are excluded from the comparison, so any of the tuple of grouping 
variables which are different across the two data frames are shown in the comparison table.
The `comparison_df` table shows all the rows for which at least one record has changed. If
nothing has changed across the two tables, the rows are not displayed. If a new record has been
introduced or a record has been removed, those are displayed as well.

For example, _Akshay, Division A_ has the exact same scores but has two different grades for _Discipline_ across 
the two years so that row is included.

However, _Macho, Division B_ has had the exact same scores in both the years, so his data is not
shown in the comparison table.

## HTML Output
While the comparison, table can be quickly summarized in various forms for futher analysis, it is 
very difficult to  process visually. The `html_output` provides a way to represent this is a way that is easier 
for the numan eye to read. NOTE: You need to install the `htmlTable` package for the HTML comparison to work.
_For the purpose of the readme I am attaching the html as a png because github markdown doesn't retain styles._

```{r, results = 'hide'}
print(ctable_student$html_output)
```

Now it is very easy to see recognize what has changed. A single cell is colored 
if it has changed across the two datasets. The value of the cell in the older dataset
is colored red and the value of the cell in the newer dataset is colored green. Cells
that haven't changed across the two datasets are colored grey.

If a new row was introduced, the Row group names (and all the other columns for that row as well )
are colored in Green. Similarly, a row group name (and the other columns in that row) are
colored red if a row was removed.

For Example, _Akshay_, _Ananth_ and _Bulla_ has had changes in 
scored, which are in _Discipline_, _Maths_, and _Maths_ respectively.
_Dhakkan_ and _Mugger_ have dropped out of the dataset from 2010 and the full rows are shown
in red, which _DikChik_ and _Vikram_ have joined new in the data set and the full rows are in green.

The same data is represented in tabular form (for further analysis, if necessary) in the
`comparison_table_diff` object

```{r}
ctable_student$comparison_table_diff
```

## Change Count and Summary
You can get an details of what has changed for each group using 
the `change_count` object in the output. A summary 
of the same is provided in the `change_summary` object.

```{r}
ctable_student$change_count
```

```{r}
ctable_student$change_summary
```

## Grouping Multiple Columns

We can also group_multiple columns into the grouping variable

```{r, results = 'hide'}
ctable_student_div = compare_df(results_2011, results_2010, c("Division", "Student"))
ctable_student_div$comparison_df
```
<img src="github_assets/pic_2.png" alt="Bring on the styles, github! " width="500" />

Now _Rohits_ in each individual division are considered as belonging to separate 
groups and compared accordingly. All the other summaries also change appropriately

## Excluding certain Columns

You can ignore certain columns using the *exclude* parameter. The fields that have to be
excluded can be given as a character vector. (This is a convenience function to deal with 
the case where some columns are not included)
